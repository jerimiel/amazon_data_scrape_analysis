# amazon_data_scrape_analysis

> This project involved the scraping of data from the amazon website and a thorough analysis to bring out market trends.

### Aim
* Clean up scraped web data to allow easy operations during analysis.
* Some problems that had to be solved during cleanup include:
* Missing data
* Wrong datatypes
* Data in the wrong form e.g. Text instead of numbers

*Carry out analysis to discover hidden trends that could be used in making business decisions.


### Data description
* Product_name : The name of the particular product
* Price : Current price of the product
* Real_price: price of product without discount
* Rating: rating of product out of 5
* Reviews: Number of reviews of the product
* Brand_name: Brand of product




### Trends spotted in the data
* Using the price weight comparison barchart we can compare how the price of a brand relates to it's popularity, therefore for example, an expensive brand which seems to be liked a lot is the brooks and conversely a cheap one that seems to be quite popular is the skechers brand. Using this information, important business decisions could be made.

* For the five most popular shoes, Bruno Marc and Dream pairs dominate the left part of the graph showing that they are of lower price but still popular and well rated while Merrell and Adidas populate the right hand side showing they are the more expensive of the top five. Skechers finds its way in-between these groups and so is of average expense in the most popular shoes. This helps to show that a business trying to maximize profit while maintaining cost should go for Bruno Marc and Dream pairs brands.

* There might be an inverse relationship between price and weighted review. Could mean that more affordable shoes do get more appreciation by consumers.
